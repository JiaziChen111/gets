{synopt :{cmd:vce(}{it:vcetype}{cmd:)}}determines the type of standard error reported in the estimated regression model, and allows standard errors that are robust to certain types of misspecification. vcetype may be robust, cluster clustvar, bootstrap, or jackknife.
{p_end}
{...}
{synopt :{cmd:xt(be|fe|re)}}specifies that the model is based on panel data. The user must specify whether they wish to estimate a random-effects (RE), fixed-effects (FE), or between-effects (BE) model. {help xtset} must be specified prior to using this option.
{p_end}

{synopt :{opt ts}}specifies that the model is based on time-series data. {help tsset} must be specified prior to using this option, and if specified, time-series operators may be used.

{synopt :{opt nodiag:nostic}}turns off the initial diagnostic tests for model misspecification. This should be used with caution.

{title:Description}

{p 6 6 2}
{hi:gets} is an algorithm for general-to-specific model prediction in Stata.  From a user-defined general unrestricted model (GUM), {cmd:gets} searches for the best possible final model among optimal subsets of the general model. The user passes the GUM to {cmd:gets} as a {it:yvar} and a group of {it:xvars} which are potentially important elements in the GUM.  The initial GUM is tested for congruence, and then multiple search paths are followed.  A potential final specification is reached when no further restrictions of the GUM remain congruent, and/or no further insignificant variables remain.

{p 6 6 2}
{hi:gets} allows the user to run the model prediction algorithm for a time-series, cross-sectional, or panel data models.  In the case of time series or panel data models, the user must specifiy the {cmd:ts} or {cmd:xt} option, and {help tsset} or {help xtset} the data respectively.  For panel data models, the user written xtserial command is used.  This option does not accept factor variable operators (for example i., c#). If factor variable operators are used with the {cmd:xt} option, {cmd:noserial} should be specified.
